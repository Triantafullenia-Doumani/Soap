## Web Services

The term Web service (WS) is either:

* a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web, or
* a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images).
In a Web service a Web technology such as HTTP is used for transferring machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON.

# Rules for communication different systems need to be defined, such as:

* How one system can request data from another system.
* Which specific parameters are needed in the data request.
* What would be the structure of the data produced. (Normally, data is exchanged in XML files, and the structure of the XML file is validated against a .xsd file.)
* What error messages to display when a certain rule for communication is not observed, to make troubleshooting easier.

# Random 

* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
* Extensible Markup Language (XML).
